# PHASE II
# Embodied Digital Instrumental Systems: performer-system perspectives

Welcome to the information page for the study *EDIS: performer-system perspectives*. Currently we are in **Phase II** of the study. **Phase I** instructions have been moved [here](pages/phaseI.md) (link). The main outcomes are: 

1. recreation study
1. sound-tracing study

## 1. Recreation Study
In this section of phase II the audio from the video sections chosen during the interviews will be used as 'scores'. There are 6 audio clips in total. On average the clips are longer than planned. To accommodate this and ensure that the recreation study does not take longer than planned, I will send an email to each of you indicating 4 audio clips to focus on and then if you have time or would simply like to do all 6 feel free complete the remaining 2.
