# EDIS: TUTORIAL video recording
In this tutorial we set out some criteria to aim for when capturing your video documentation. 
The goal of the video documentation is to capture both:
1. ***your physical movements and their interaction with the technology***; and, 
1. ***your computer screen*** and/or resources that guide your performance (notation/GUI/software displays/etc/) -- if this is something that is significant to the performance of your system in that you continually or somewhat periodically negotiate with it during performance. That is, it contains relevant information related to your actions during performance. 

We can think of these two criteria in terms of: 
- what information would be communicated to an audience; and, 
- what information is "your system" communicating to you the performer, respectively. 

Thus, depending on your system -- number 2. may, or may not, apply. If you are unsure please let me know so we can work out the best strategy. 

- with screen or not
- with headphones or not

As an example, I will go over how I document my system. The four main interfaces I use are: 
-  a pen & ipad, 
- multi-touch and ipad (two ipads total), 
- a kai gestural controller (motion sensor and simple binary finger tracking), 
- and a microphone. 

Therefore, my hands and mouth/head (and the relevant interfaces) are the focus of interaction, along with my computer screen. 

To capture these elements I have found that a video-camara placed in front of me and above gets the best view of my hands while also capturing my head/mouth. I use my iphone and a make-shift stand to get the appropriate height. 

For screen capture I use quicktime (native to mac OS). I assume PC/windows/linux users have a native screen recorder. If not I have found OBS (free) to be useful for screen recording and live streaming. Though there are many options out there free and paid. 
One thing to note - **in both your video and screen recording please include audio and this is helpful for syncing the video. Once you start your video and screen recorder if you could clap such as to provide a slate for syncing.** 

1. set up your screen recorder to capture your system audio output
1. set up your video recorder to capture the room. 
1. when you have started both screen and video recorders clap your hands to provide a syncing point for the audio and video. 

If you are playing through speakers and not using headphones (as I do) you can ignore the previous audio routing.
