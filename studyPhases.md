# EDIS: performer-perspectives - overview of 3 phases
## The first phase includes:
1.  Review online tutorials for:
    1. setting up, configuring and testing the capture module for control data and audio. This will include setting up your system to send the control data to the capture module (ex. through UPD sends) if this is not already implemented. Please let me know or remind me if sending the control data is something you need help setting up. 1 hour
    1. self-documenting your performance participation through audio-video recording. 30 min
2.  Complete the introductory online questionnaire – 10 minutes
3.  Document a 20-30-minute performance session (video and session capture module)
    1.  the approach to this is up to you – an improvisation, rehearsal, study, etc.
4.  Provide a guided reflection (written, audio, or video recording) of the session documented – 15-30 minutes
5.  Dependant on scheduling but ideally during phase one. Participate in a semi-structured online (zoom) interview – 1 hour
## The second phase includes:
6.  Listening to 6-12 audio segments from participants of this study (accessed online) between 7 and 90 sec  
    1.  self-document yourself recreating the segments of audio with your digital instrumental system (audio-video and session capture module) – 1-2 hours
7.  Install mobile device application
    1.  using your mobile device as a motion sensor and for capturing data, move to 12 segments of audio 7-90 sec in length (from participants of this study) as if you were creating/performing them with the mobile device. 30 min
## The third phase
8.  Dependant on scheduling but ideally soon after the completion of phase two. Participate in an online (zoom) group discussion – 2 hours
